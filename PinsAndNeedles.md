## Pins And Needles

**Project description:** Pins and Needles is a 2D platformer project with advanced movement elements. Play as Stitch and travel through multiple sewed-on stages to defeat the tyrannical Pin King.

**Tasks:** Pins and Needles was one of my first freelancing contracts. I was the sole programmer for the project fabricating UI, game architecture, physics, particle effects, user feedback, and level design. The project was a massive undertaking and took approximately three months to complete.
