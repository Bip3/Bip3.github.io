## Minesweeper for Nintendo Switch

### About This Project

Minesweeper for the Nintendo Switch is a 2D puzzle game in which the player combs a field of tiles for randomly placed bombs. Each clicked tile will tell the player how many mines are adjacent to the tile, so they can place markers on each mine. Find all the mines and you win!

### My Role

I was the sole programmer for Minesweeper for Nintendo Switch, working concurrently with artists and SFX designers to assemble the project. My responsibilities included:

- Game Architecture Development
- UI Interface Design
- PC and Console Control Integration
- Cross-Platform Compatibility
