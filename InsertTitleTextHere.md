## Insert Title Text Here

**Project description:** Insert Title Text Here is a 2D platformer with advanced movement mechanics. Control an untitled player navigating through the world of limbo, where the player is unable to see themselves and the incoming obstacles concurrently.

**Tasks:** Insert Title Text Here was a submission to the Ludum Dare Game Jam competition and was created in under 24 hours. I placed fairly well for my first jam and was responsible for every asset in the project including art, sound, voice-overs, physics, game architecture, and UI.
