## Nintendo Labo Project

### About This Project

This was a short commission to design enemy AI for a video game utilizing Nintendo Labo technologies. The game is in the style of a tower defense in which enemies attack fortresses one by one and the player must defend them by constructing physical defenses which are converted virtually.

### My Role

I created the default enemy AI for the project with the following features:

- Randomized movement patterns
- Dynamic cover system allowing enemies to take cover
- Strategic positioning behind structures
- Demolition behavior targeting grey structures

The brown boxes are randomly generated obstacles enemies use for cover, and the grey boxes are structures enemies line up behind to demolish.
