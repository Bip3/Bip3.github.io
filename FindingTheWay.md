## Finding The Way

### About This Project

Finding The Way was my first project for mobile devices. It is a game inspired by the popular hit, Flappy Bird, in which the player has to navigate through obstacles by flapping.

### My Role

This began as a practice project, but soon I decided to format it for mobile and publish it to learn more about the mobile publishing process. I was responsible for:

- Art Creation
- Sound Effects Design
- Game Architecture
- UI Design
- Loot Box Interface for Character Skins
