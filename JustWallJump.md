## Just WallJump

### About This Project

Just WallJump is a mobile 2D action platformer following the walljumper ninja traversing obstacles by jumping from wall to wall up a vertical tower. The game includes a global leaderboard system, served advertisements, and procedurally generated obstacles.

### My Role

Just WallJump was one of my first independent projects outside of freelance. I initiated the project to learn more about networking by creating an online leaderboard, but it quickly escalated into a full IOS and Android release.

I was the sole programmer for the project, responsible for:

- Game Architecture
- UI Development
- Physics System
- Online Leaderboard Integration

I also collaborated with:
- Artists for environment and character design
- Composer for the game's soundtrack
